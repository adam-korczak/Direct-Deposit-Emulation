My response to the VIVA engineering take home code challenge for the junior developer role. 

# Setup/Dependencies

Built in Windows with Python 3.12.4. [Python 3.12.4 Stable Release](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3124)
	
If requests library not installed, run 'pip install requests'.
	Libraries:
	 - import requests
	 - import csv
	 - import json
	 
	Run with: 'python main.py'. Afterwards, expects a user input in the format of YYYY-MM-DD.
	 Valid range includes 2024-06-14 to 2024-06-28.

	Delete or move 'processedPayments.csv' before attempting to run main.py and generating a new output.

> Post-challenge thoughts: It was my first time actually getting the chance to work with pagination so at first I was a bit confused when testing it in Postman admittedly, but it ended up feeling really intuitive and felt like fun to work on. Definitely felt like a more engaging challenge than most "linear" feeling ones without being unreasonably difficult.
